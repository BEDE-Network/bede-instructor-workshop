# BEDE Network "Train-the-Instructor" workshop

These materials were initially developed as a `tidyverse`-focused workshop to train college-level instructors in use of R and RStudio in their biology and environmental science courses.

## Learning objectives: 
By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
* Explain the utility of R + RStudio as a teaching tool
* Create an .Rmd file and use it to document a sequence of R
functions
* Apply tidyverse functions to read in, wrangle, analyze,
and visualize biological/environmental data
* Evaluate potential pinch points for integration of R in your
classroom and discuss strategies to work through them

## Previous uses:
These materials were initially developed by Kait Farrell (@farrellkj) for a March 2024 BEDE Network workshop at the University of Puget Sound.
